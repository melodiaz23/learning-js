# REACT

- React is a JS library for building user interfaces (UI).

    **JS**
    - Runs in the browser.
    - We can manipulate the HTML structure (DOM) on the page.
    - Allow us to change what the users sees without fetching a new HTML page.

While with vanilla js we need to write/describe every single step (imperative aproach), with react 

So, react is: 

- Client-side JS library.
- It's all about building modern reactive user interfaces for websites.
- Declarative, component focused approach.
- It could be use to control parts of HTML or to control de ENTIRE frontend (SPA - Single-page-application).
