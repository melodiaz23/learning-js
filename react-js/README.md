# REACT

- React is a JS library for building user interfaces (UI).

    **JS**
    - Runs in the browser.
    - We can manipulate the HTML structure (DOM) on the page.
    - Allow us to change what the users sees without fetching a new HTML page.

While with vanilla js we need to write/describe every single step (imperative aproach), with react we are able to write declarative code.

So, react is: 

- Client-side JS library.
- It's all about building modern reactive user interfaces for websites.
- Declarative, component focused approach.
- It could be use to control parts of HTML or to control de ENTIRE frontend (SPA - Single-page-application).

**To started a JS project:**

- https://create-react-app.dev/
- https://vitejs.dev/

With vite: 

npm create vite (first time)
npm init vite

On the console: 
npm install
npm run dev

npm install icons  // Install library

raect router -> npm install react-router-dom   

## Components and building UIs

- Components are functions that return tipically, JSX code.

- This code is executed multiple times, this mean we get separated 'component instances'.
